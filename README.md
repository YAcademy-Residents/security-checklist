# Security Checklist

The goal is to make a comprehensive checklist of common smart contract errors that can be used in many different contexts. This list intends to make it clearer what is an incorrect and correct pattern looks like to make it easier for anyone to better understand these common issues.

## Format

This checklist is built with [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), which uses .rst files that have different syntax than the markdown files you might be more familiar with. There are more details in the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
